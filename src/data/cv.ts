    summary: `I am a Technical Lead who likes to get the job done. I like challenges, and find fulfillment in solving them. From my early years as an engineer, I've had the opportunity to work on products both at startups and larger companies, in various industries, including consulting, media, web analytics and industrial tech. My main interests are web development, cloud infrastructure, architecture, security and performance. I also dabble in data science/machine learning (this being what I studied at university).`,
